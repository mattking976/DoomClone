## About The Project

---

This project is designed to help me learn some game development as a hobby but also to see how far I can put this project and see what a community of developers can do. This project is written in gd script and I personally am using vscode as a code editor. Feel free to fork this project and make some changes to it please do some rigorous testing of anything you create then raise a pull request.
